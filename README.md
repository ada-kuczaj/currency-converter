## About me
 My name is **Adriana Kuczaj** and I am currently in the first year of studies at the University of Economics in Wroc≈Çaw. My major is IT in Business.

 In addition to my studies, I also try to pursue various courses and workshops to develop my knowledge and programming skills.

## Project aim

 This page was created to remember the material from the online course I am a participant of. The course was created by **YouCode** - Internet Programing School.

## How to use the calculator
To use the currency calculator, you need to select the appropriate currencies - the currency in which you have funds and the currency for which you want to exchange your funds. At the top, enter the amount you want to exchange. Then click the CONVERT button. The result will appear below the currency calculator.

Using the currency calculator, it's easy to check:

- how much is your capital worth in foreign currency

- how much money in foreign currency your savings are worth

- how much foreign currency you will receive for a certain number of zlotys.

In the future, I also intend to supplement the project with an API, so that the rates are constantly updated and consistent with those on the main NBP website.

## Demo
Check out how it works :)
